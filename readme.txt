My project is a music composition software created using Tkinter, PyAudio, and 
pydub. To install, download and unzip the project zip file, open the file
composYour.py and run it. If being run a computer that does not already have
PyAudio, you can download it from: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/
